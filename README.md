# WEATHER APPLICATION

## ABOUT

This project deals with the concept of data fetching from a weather API.

I have created a weather app using the Tkinter module in Python.

The application asks the user to enter city name and then click on the button.

When the button is clicked it shows the weather information about that particular city.

## IMAGES 

Below are some images related to the weather-app

1. After the code is compiled, a GUI window is popped up with dimensions 600x500

2. When user enters a city name and click the button then the weather information is showed up

Likewise, you can enter any city you want and get the weather information(domestic as well as international)



3. If user enters a wrong city name then API fetching shows an error
